Welcome to TranslateGame!

In this game, you will guess what words or phrases in other languages mean. 

This project is mainly written in Java, but utilizes Python and Google Scripts for translating and assigning 
scores to the words/phrases.

How to install:
1. Download this repository
2. Enter the "download" folder
3. Double click the "clickheretorun" bat file

As of now, the game only works if you run the "gameselect" java file in the translategame folder.
I am currently working on fixing this issue and will keep this project updated.
